      <p>I'm a web designer residing in Edison, NJ. I was born in New Brunswick, NJ in 1986. My first memory is eating poptarts and the band whitesnake playing on my tv, so I learned to control my hair at a young age. I love to create, and my hobbies include writing and music. I like to think outside of the box, so that I can better understand the box. I'm naturally curious, and I'm always looking to improve, even when things are excellent. On the developer side, I'm particularly interested in Ruby and Python but my skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL etc. On the front end I particularly enjoy CSS and styling. I'm very flexible and want to create the best product for your business, whatever it requires of me. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Most of my life I have done manual labor jobs, and later I got into the limo industry until I decided to get into web development in 2016. I started learning Ruby on my own and then decided I should go to school to get the remainder of skills needed to succeed in the field, so I enrolled to the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.</p>
